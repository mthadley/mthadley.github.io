title: Six Weeks in Spain
---

As I sit here writing this post in an Apartment in downtown Madrid, I have spent
the last month living and working here in Spain. I'm very grateful for the
opportunity I was given to come here, and also very humbled by the people I met.
It's amazing to see how friendly and welcoming everyone was to both me and my
friends that I came here with. Spain has been truly a beautiful place to spend
this time in, and the people I spent it with certainly made it an experience I
will not soon forget.

It's the longest I have spent away from home, and I definitely miss it now. I
know in the end it will still be the home that I left, but it feels very surreal
given how much has happened while I was gone. We have a new and extremely
polarizing president elect, and there seems to be so much emotion in what I have
seen and read while I have been away. The future seems so uncertain, however I
believe we as Americans will try our best to do what is right.

Either way, I should be back in a few days. So thanks Madrid, and maybe I'll see
you again soon.
