title: Wait, You Have A Blog?
---

Yea, I guess I have a blog. Writing or keeping a journal was never really a thing for me, and to be honest, I give this post a 75% chance of being my last. Ok, maybe that is a little pessimistic. Either way, whatever I do post will most likely be programming related (maybe some linux or web related stuff), or potentially something else that happens to interest me.

So until next time, I leave you with that one George Michael song:
